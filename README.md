# Introduction to Algorithms

Cousera online course, [Introduction to Algorithms][1], created by Princeton
University, taught by: _Kevin Wayne_, Senior Lecturer and _Robert Sedgewick_,
Professor.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs
to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and
scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers
elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses
on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

All my assignments have score of 100 percent, so feel free to read them if you
need any inspiration.
